# Running Commission Today on your computer

## Install Prerequisites

Before you can run Commission Today, you'll need to have the following software
packages installed on your computer: Git, Ruby 2.1+, RVM, and PhantomJS.
If you're on a Linux machine, you'll also need Node.js.

If you already have all of the prerequisites installed, you can go straight
to the [Installation](#install-ohana-web-search). Otherwise, you'll need to
install the following tools manually:

- [Build tools][build-tools]
- [Ruby with RVM][ruby]
- [PhantomJS][phantomjs] (only used for running the tests)
- [Node.js][node] (Linux only)
